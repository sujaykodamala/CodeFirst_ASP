    <b>About the Value of Bible</b>
    <p>        
It is our basis of our belief. It is uniquely God-inspired, 
without error, and is our final authority on all matters of faith and conduct. (2 Timothy 3:16, Romans 12:2)
    </p>
    <b>About the nature of God</b>
    <p>We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Matthew 3:16, 17, Matthew 28:18, 19) God is our creator (Genesis 1). God is perfect love.
       He desires for each of us is to experience an ongoing personal relationship with Him</p>
    <b>About the person and work of HolySpirit</b>
    <p>
        The Holy Spirit indwells and enables the Christian to live a Godly 
        life (John 14:16, John 15:26, Galatians 5:22-25, Philippians 1:16, Philippians 2:13).
    </p>
        
    <b>About the value of Humanity</b>
    <p>God created us in his image, with a mind, will emotions and a sense of morality. 
        All human life has value. To fulfill God's purpose for us, we each need to experience 
        forgiveness of sin by faith in Jesus Christ, and live out our new life in Christ and
         participation in healthy community in the church. (Romans 3:23; 6:23 Romans 12:1-2, Hebrews 10:24-25).</p>

    <b>About the Identity of Jesus</b>
    <p>We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ (Colossians 2:9), 
      in His virgin birth as fully human (Matthew 1:18-23), in His sinless life (2 Corinthians 5:21).</p>
    <b>About our need for salvation, and God's provision of it</b>
    <p>God created us to have an intimate relationship with Him. We all by nature sin, 
        violating or falling short of God's law, and going our own way, (Romans 3:23 Isaiah 53:6)
         Because of His love, God sent his Son, Jesus to die on the cross to pay the penalty of our sin, 
        and reconcile us with God (John 3:16, Romans 5:6-10) We must individually receive God's gift of 
        forgiveness and reconciliation by faith in Christ. (John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9)</p>
    <b>About the Church</b>
    <p>We recognize and embrace the Church as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-18).
         The Church was established by Christ (Matthew 16:18) and He is the Head of the Church (Ephesians 1:22). 
        Those who place their faith in Jesus Christ for their salvation and trust Him as
         Lord are members of His church. (Matthew 16:16, Romans 10:9-10). As an outward expression
         of that faith and commitment we follow God's command to practice believer's baptism. (Matthew 28:19).</p>
