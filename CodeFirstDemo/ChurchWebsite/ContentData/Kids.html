    <i>"But Jesus called for them, saying, Permit the children to come to Me, 
    and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."</i>
    <p>From our Bible centered curriculum to our interactive worship, our children’s ministry is a safe, 
        fun, easy to learn, and Christ centered place for your children to grow in the Lord. Jesus loved 
        the little children and so do we. We help the children understand what the Bible teaches and who 
         they are in Christ. Our goal is to train these
         little ones to be used as arrows in the hands of our lord and shine as stars in His Kingdom.</p>
