   <h2>Weekly Prayer</h2> 
<p>"And they devoted themselves to the apostles'
     teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers" Act 2:42.</p>

<p>As a day of preparation, we take time to come to our Lord in leaning on him for all things concerning our lives and the ministry done here. We do so by praying for all the upcoming services(Bible Studies, Sunday Worship Services) and the ministries around them. 
    We also pray for the weekly prayer updates along with any new prayer requests requested for prayer.</p>

 
<h3>Monthly Prayer</h3>
<p>"For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand…" Psalm 84:10</p>

<p>On the Friday(usually the last of every month) we have an extended time of prayer where we pray for all church ministries & families, missionaries, salvation requests, 
    upcoming events apart from the regular items which include songs(worship & prayer oriented, will take choices), short worship time, exhortation from God’s word, 
    and any special prayer requests received.</p>
