<p>"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.." – Eccl 12:1</p>
    <p>It is a great blessing to remember the Lord in the days of our youth. 
        Today’s youth are tomorrow’s leaders only if we invest time and effort to bring them up 
        in the wisdom and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ‘The Prince of Preachers’ 
        By <i>Charles Spurgeon</i> gave his first sermon and became a pastor when he was 16 years old. When God can raise such mighty preachers, 
        it is possible that he is able to do the same again with these young souls.</p>
  <p>"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" – Hebrews 13:8</p>
    <p>The Youth ministry at “Beloved” seeks the Youth to commit their life to Christ.
         As we read in Lam 3:27, "It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth",
         the Youth teachers empower young people to become followers of Christ. It is a wonderful 
        thing to teach the youth so that they can hope, trust 
        and witness God’s works in their lives just as the psalmist reminds us in the Word of God:</p>
    <p>"For thou art my hope, O Lord God: thou art my trust from my youth." – Psalm 71:5
"O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works." – Psalm 71:17
 </p>
    <p>The Youth sit with their parents during the worship time and are dismissed to the Youth 
        classes during the main message. In the Youth Class, the teachers take a lesson following a book. 
        The current book that we are following is ‘Fundamentals of Faith’– By John Macarthur. We have great 
        burden for our young people’s spiritual growth and keep all our youth in prayers. We also encourage all 
        the youth to participate in various youth activities, songs and plays keeping in mind to give all glory and 
        honor to Christ. In the past,
         "Beloved" youth are involved in various video plays with a wonderful gospel message.</p>
    <p>You can find them in our video recordings page at this site.
        We sincerely request you to keep this ministry in your prayers, 
        that God may pour our his Spirit of Grace upon these young lives, and that they may be a great witness unto God,
         and that they may be great men and women of Faith serving the Lord.</p>
