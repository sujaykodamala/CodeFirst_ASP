<p>"How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word."</p> (Psalm 119:9).
 
<p>The Bible clearly states that the only way a young man can keep his ways pure is by guarding it according it to God’s word. 
    We want to give the pre-teens an early start to walk in God’s pure ways.</p>
