    <p>The greatest missionary, who ever lived on earth was the LORD Jesus Christ Himself. He left his father’s abode, the glories of Heaven and took the form of a man, and died on a cruel Cross, so that He might reconcile sinful men and women back to God. His message was God’s great love for mankind.</p>
 
<p>It is our desire as recipients of God's great love; to obey our LORD's great commission in Matthew 28:19-20 (NASB) 19 <i>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</i> 
    In response, we currently sponsor and prayerfully partner with three ministries, two in the northern India and the other in southern India that focus on sharing the good news of our LORD Jesus Christ and making disciples. For safety reasons, the ministries will remain anonymous.</p>
 
<p>John Stott, the British preacher states below as the essence of 'Missions':
'Missions' is an activity of God arising out of the very nature of God. The living God of the Bible is a sending God, which is what ‘mission’ means. He sent the prophets to Israel. He sent his Son into the world. His Son sent out the apostles, and the seventy, and the church. He also sent the Spirit to the church and sends Him(Spirit) into our hearts today.
We continue to look to the LORD for the current missions that we support and also any new mission opportunities that the enables us to prayerfully partner and ask His blessings both on the missionaries, their families and the ‘missions’ ministry of "Beloved's" church.</p>
