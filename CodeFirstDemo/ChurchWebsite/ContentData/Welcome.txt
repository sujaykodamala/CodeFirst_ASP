Coming to a church service for the first time can be both exciting and also intimidating experience. We appreciate the desire to come join us and hope the time you will spend in worship with us will be both meaningful and a blessed one starting from here.

Our Worship Services are characterized a mix of both traditional and contemporary where everything that happens is centered around God and Christ, His word, His glory and for the blessing and edification of His people.

All Sunday Worshipservices begins with a word of prayer which quickly leads us to a lively and traditional worship songs with Christ exalting and God glorifying themes. It is then followed by a devotion or worship exhortation where congregants are given the opportunity to worship with a song or few words that come from a broken and a contrite heart.That is then followed by the communion time as we come around the Lord's table where everyone who has trusted and received Jesus as Lord and Savior are welcome to part-take.This is followed by Worship with free-will offering unto our Lord, announcements with the introduction of the newcomers. We let the first time guests be introduced and welcomed. We then have the ministering of God's word which is concluded with a prayer and benediction.

Right after the worship service(s) there is a time of fellowship usually in the other building with food(either Lunch or Snack) where there is an opportunity to really connect and get to know each other better so that we may better serve one another in Christ.
