    <i> "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law".Psalm 119:18 
"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth".  2 Tim 2:15</i>
 
<p>As a day of devoting to Studying the Scripture, we come to do an inductive bible study to understand and glean precious truths from God's word,
     where the learning is for living so that our lives be made as walking epistles of Christ for the glory of God and also a blessing to others.
  bible study groups gather every Friday from 8:00 PM to 10:15 PM at various locations. Please contact host or bible study co-ordinator for location and other details.</p>
